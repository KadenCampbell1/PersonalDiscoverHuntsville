GDC,Finished,"$600 from grant with presentation on three things from the conference.

Ask ""Is there a medium I could reach out to you on?""

As for questions, that's always a challenging topic as everyone conversation will be so different. You might try to focus more on who you're talking to and what specific insights they may provide rather than a generic set of questions. People always enjoy talking more about themselves anyway. You might ask about their path into industry, recommendations for research/learning, artists they follow, company culture, what the hiring process is like and how it's changed post-pandemic (or wherever we are with that), etc. And don't forget to ask to add them to your network, try to push your name a little as well, and follow-up after the conference to show you're serious about it.

look for the mentors guild. Ask what makes a strong art portfolio. remove the 2D art and game design stuff. can you give me some feedback to make my portfolio like you. what can I do to be more prepared for the industry or next time. build a business card. Go and soke up as much as you can.",,,,
