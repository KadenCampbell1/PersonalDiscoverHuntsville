This week I was able to Finish the layout design for the space scene. I was able to organize my scene and files associated with my project. I greyboxed the scene.  I wasn't able to finish modeling the ship this week. I have gotten a fair way through it. All I need to do is make the little ranger and pipe the insides.

The colors represent what shares a texture. Green is the the main ship, Blue is the attachments, and the pipes are red because they are procedurally generated on their own UV plane. I plan to use 3 2048px maps.

I'm thinking about keeping the 15 second increments as separate videos and have 2 videos per environment I create. My goal is to create 2 environments this semester. The first environment I want to do is a space station orbiting a star. The second a rustic forest with a village or temple. I want to do these two environments because the first will show competence in hard surface modeling and VFX, while the second deals with organics and lighting. 

My plan for your class is to create a nice presentation of my process in creating the scene with weekly breakdowns and explanations of my goals for the week and what I had accomplished the week prior. I think this will make a nice addition to the videos for my portfolio.","DGM3620 Anim Apps (Rodayne),DGM3650/3620 Anthony, Rodayne",,,
