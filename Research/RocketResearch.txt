Ariane 5

a European heavy-lift space launch vehicle developed and operated by Arianespace for the European Space Agency (ESA).
 
It is launched from the Centre Spatial Guyanais (CSG) in French Guiana.

The James Webb Space Telescope was launched on an Ariane 5 rocket for NASA.

The Ariane 5 is one of the world's most reliable launch vehicles and was chosen for a combination of reliability (it was the only launch vehicle that met NASA's requirements for launching a mission like Webb) and for the value it brings via our international partnership.

In exchange European scientists are given a fraction of observing time on Webb (roughly 15%).

capable of carry payloads weighing more than 10 metric tons to geostationary transfer orbit.

The launch vehicle had a streak of 82 consecutive successful launches between 9 April 2003 and 12 December 2017.

Ariane 5 was originally intended to launch the Hermes spacecraft, and thus it is rated for human space launches.

After the main cryogenic stage runs out of fuel, it re-enters the atmosphere for an ocean splashdown.

They each burn for 130 seconds before being dropped into the ocean. The SRBs are usually allowed to sink to the bottom of the ocean, but, like the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters, they can be recovered with parachutes, and this has occasionally been done for post-flight analysis.

Ariane 5 boosters are not reused.

The second stage is on top of the main stage and below the payload.

The flight assembly includes the Vehicle Equipment Bay, with flight electronics for the entire rocket, and the payload interface and structural support.






Space Launch System

Model is the Block 1 crew configuration.

an American super heavy-lift launch vehicle that provides the foundation for human exploration beyond Earth’s orbit.

SLS is the only rocket that can send Orion, astronauts, and cargo directly to the Moon on a single mission.

SLS, the world’s most powerful rocket, can carry more payload to deep space than any other vehicle.

The SLS rocket is designed to be evolvable, which makes it possible to fly more types of missions, including human missions to the Moon and Mars and robotic scientific missions to places like the Moon, Mars, Saturn, and Jupiter.

The first SLS vehicle, called Block 1, can send more than 27 metric tons (t) or 59,500 pounds (lbs.) to orbits beyond the Moon.

The Block 1B crew vehicle can send 38 t (83,700 lbs.) to deep space including Orion and its crew.

Block 2, will provide 9.5 million lbs. of thrust and will be the workhorse vehicle for sending cargo to the Moon, Mars, and other deep space destinations.

SLS Block 2 will be designed to lift more than 46 t (101,400 lbs.) to deep space.

Artemis I, the first integrated flight of SLS and Orion, uses the Block 1 configuration.

The first launch, designated Artemis 1, is scheduled for 16 November 2022

Atlas V-541

Atlas V rockets are only used once.

Human rated

The three numbers in the 541 designation signify a payload fairing, or nose cone, that is approximately 5 meters (16.4 feet) in diameter; four solid-rocket boosters fastened alongside the central common core booster; and a one-engine Centaur upper stage.

the first stage (Atlas V rocket) is the common core booster, 106.5 feet (32.46 meters) in length and 12.5 feet (3.81 meters) in diameter. about half of the total height of the vehicle.

First stage thrust of up to about 850,000 pounds (3.8 million newtons) at full throttle.

Stage 2 (Centaur) Fuel and oxidizer and the vehicle's "brains". fires twice, once to insert the vehicle-spacecraft stack into low Earth orbit and then again to accelerate the spacecraft out of Earth orbit and on its way towards Mars.

Stage 2 This engine uses liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen and can provide up to about 22,300 pounds (99,200 newtons) of thrust.

Were not phased out due to the Challenger Disaster of 1986

The Delta II family used a four-digit system to generate its technical names:

-The first digit was either 6 or 7, denoting the 6000- or 7000-series Delta.

-The second digit indicated the number of boosters. Most Delta II rockets flew with 9 boosters, but some flew with 3 or 4.

-The third digit was always 2, denoting a second stage with an Aerojet AJ10 engine. Only Deltas prior to the 6000-series used a different engine, the TR-201.

-The last digit denoted the third stage. 0 denoted no third stage, 5 indicated a Payload Assist Module (PAM) stage with Star 48B solid motor, and 6 indicated a Star 37FM motor.

-An H following the four digits denoted that the vehicle used the larger Delta III GEM-46 boosters. The Heavy variant could be launched only from Cape Canaveral (as Vandenberg's pad wasn't modified to handle the larger SRBs), and was retired with the closure of that launch site in 2011.[30]

-Numbers and letters following those indicate the type of fairing. -9.5 means that the vehicle had a 9.5 ft (2.9 m) diameter fairing, -10 means a 10 ft (3.0 m) diameter fairing, and -10L indicates a lengthened 10 ft (3.0 m) diameter fairing. In a few rare circumstances, an 8-foot diameter fairing (from older Delta rockets) was flown, and those vehicles had a -8 designation.

The only person on record ever hit by space debris was hit by a piece of a Delta II rocket.

-Lottie Williams was exercising in a park in Tulsa on 22 January 1997 when she was hit in the shoulder by a 15-centimeter (6 in) piece of blackened metallic material. U.S. Space Command confirmed that a used Delta II rocket from the April 1996 launch of the Midcourse Space Experiment had crashed into the atmosphere 30 minutes earlier. The object tapped her on the shoulder and fell off harmlessly onto the ground.






Lunar Module

originally designated the Lunar Excursion Module (LEM), was the lunar lander spacecraft that was flown between lunar orbit and the Moon's surface during the United States' Apollo program. 

carried to lunar orbit by the companion Command Service Module (CSM)

It was the first crewed spacecraft to operate exclusively in the airless vacuum of space, and remains the only crewed vehicle to land anywhere beyond Earth.

Structurally and aerodynamically incapable of flight through Earth's atmosphere

The final three landers were more advanced versions of the original, carried a Lunar Rover Vehicle - nicknamed the Moon Buggy - and enabled longer stays on the surface.

First crewed vehicle to land on the moon.

Apollo 11 launched from Cape Kennedy on July 16, 1969

During the 1969 Apollo 11 mission, Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit while fellow crewmembers Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin descended to the moon's surface in the lunar module.

Armstrong's televised image and heard his voice describe the event as he took "...one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind" on July 20, 1969.

the Eagle landed in the Sea of Tranquility in Site 2

The crew began descent on the 13th orbit of the moon

Saturn V

American super heavy-lift launch vehicle for human exploration of the Moon

The rocket was human-rated

flown from 1967 to 1973.

It was used for nine crewed flights to the Moon, and to launch Skylab, the first American space station.

As of 2022, the Saturn V remains the only launch vehicle to carry humans beyond low Earth orbit (LEO).

Project cost	$6.417 billion in 1964–1973 dollars (~$49.9 billion in 2020 dollars)

Cost per launch	$185 million in 1969–1971 dollars ($1.23 billion in 2019 value).

Height	363.0 ft (110.6 m)

Diameter	33.0 ft (10.1 m)

Saturn V weighed 2.8 million kilograms (6.2 million pounds)

Stages	2 (3 for Apollo missions)

Status	Retired

Total launches	13

Partial failure(s)	1 (Apollo 6)

First flight	November 9, 1967

Last flight	May 14, 1973

the Saturn V was designed under the direction of Wernher von Braun

Thirteen were launched from Kennedy Space Center with no loss of crew or payload.

A car that gets 48 kilometers (30 miles) to the gallon could drive around the world around 800 times with the amount of fuel the Saturn V used for a lunar landing mission.

The first two stages fell into the ocean after separation. The third stage either stayed in space or hit the moon.

Atlas's stage-and-a-half configuration was seen as preferable to the two-stage Titan in that all engines were ignited at liftoff, making it easier to test for hardware problems during pre-launch checks.

chemical rockets of this era could not be reliably started So the 1 1/2 stage was designed.

As the rocket rose into the air, fuel was consumed at a fast rate. After a short period of time, the rocket became light enough and the two booster rockets were dropped. By shedding the weight of the two booster engines, the Atlas was now light enough to fly all the way to orbit using only the sustainer engine giving it the 1  1/2 stages
