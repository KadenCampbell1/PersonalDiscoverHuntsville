Ariane 5

a European heavy-lift space launch vehicle developed and operated by Arianespace for the European Space Agency (ESA).
 
It is launched from the Centre Spatial Guyanais (CSG) in French Guiana.

The James Webb Space Telescope was launched on an Ariane 5 rocket for NASA.

The Ariane 5 is one of the world's most reliable launch vehicles and was chosen for a combination of reliability (it was the only launch vehicle that met NASA's requirements for launching a mission like Webb) and for the value it brings via our international partnership.

In exchange European scientists are given a fraction of observing time on Webb (roughly 15%).

capable of carry payloads weighing more than 10 metric tons to geostationary transfer orbit.

The launch vehicle had a streak of 82 consecutive successful launches between 9 April 2003 and 12 December 2017.

Ariane 5 was originally intended to launch the Hermes spacecraft, and thus it is rated for human space launches.

After the main cryogenic stage runs out of fuel, it re-enters the atmosphere for an ocean splashdown.

They each burn for 130 seconds before being dropped into the ocean. The SRBs are usually allowed to sink to the bottom of the ocean, but, like the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters, they can be recovered with parachutes, and this has occasionally been done for post-flight analysis.

Ariane 5 boosters are not reused.

The second stage is on top of the main stage and below the payload.

The flight assembly includes the Vehicle Equipment Bay, with flight electronics for the entire rocket, and the payload interface and structural support.






Space Launch System

Model is the Block 1 crew configuration.

an American super heavy-lift launch vehicle that provides the foundation for human exploration beyond Earth’s orbit.

SLS is the only rocket that can send Orion, astronauts, and cargo directly to the Moon on a single mission.

SLS, the world’s most powerful rocket, can carry more payload to deep space than any other vehicle.

The SLS rocket is designed to be evolvable, which makes it possible to fly more types of missions, including human missions to the Moon and Mars and robotic scientific missions to places like the Moon, Mars, Saturn, and Jupiter.

The first SLS vehicle, called Block 1, can send more than 27 metric tons (t) or 59,500 pounds (lbs.) to orbits beyond the Moon.

The Block 1B crew vehicle can send 38 t (83,700 lbs.) to deep space including Orion and its crew.

Block 2, will provide 9.5 million lbs. of thrust and will be the workhorse vehicle for sending cargo to the Moon, Mars, and other deep space destinations.

SLS Block 2 will be designed to lift more than 46 t (101,400 lbs.) to deep space.

Artemis I, the first integrated flight of SLS and Orion, uses the Block 1 configuration.

The first launch, designated Artemis 1, is scheduled for 16 November 2022

Atlas V-541

Atlas V rockets are only used once.

Human rated

The three numbers in the 541 designation signify a payload fairing, or nose cone, that is approximately 5 meters (16.4 feet) in diameter; four solid-rocket boosters fastened alongside the central common core booster; and a one-engine Centaur upper stage.

the first stage (Atlas V rocket) is the common core booster, 106.5 feet (32.46 meters) in length and 12.5 feet (3.81 meters) in diameter. about half of the total height of the vehicle.

First stage thrust of up to about 850,000 pounds (3.8 million newtons) at full throttle.

Stage 2 (Centaur) Fuel and oxidizer and the vehicle's "brains". fires twice, once to insert the vehicle-spacecraft stack into low Earth orbit and then again to accelerate the spacecraft out of Earth orbit and on its way towards Mars.

Stage 2 This engine uses liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen and can provide up to about 22,300 pounds (99,200 newtons) of thrust.

Were not phased out due to the Challenger Disaster of 1986

The Delta II family used a four-digit system to generate its technical names:

-The first digit was either 6 or 7, denoting the 6000- or 7000-series Delta.

-The second digit indicated the number of boosters. Most Delta II rockets flew with 9 boosters, but some flew with 3 or 4.

-The third digit was always 2, denoting a second stage with an Aerojet AJ10 engine. Only Deltas prior to the 6000-series used a different engine, the TR-201.

-The last digit denoted the third stage. 0 denoted no third stage, 5 indicated a Payload Assist Module (PAM) stage with Star 48B solid motor, and 6 indicated a Star 37FM motor.

-An H following the four digits denoted that the vehicle used the larger Delta III GEM-46 boosters. The Heavy variant could be launched only from Cape Canaveral (as Vandenberg's pad wasn't modified to handle the larger SRBs), and was retired with the closure of that launch site in 2011.[30]

-Numbers and letters following those indicate the type of fairing. -9.5 means that the vehicle had a 9.5 ft (2.9 m) diameter fairing, -10 means a 10 ft (3.0 m) diameter fairing, and -10L indicates a lengthened 10 ft (3.0 m) diameter fairing. In a few rare circumstances, an 8-foot diameter fairing (from older Delta rockets) was flown, and those vehicles had a -8 designation.

The only person on record ever hit by space debris was hit by a piece of a Delta II rocket.

-Lottie Williams was exercising in a park in Tulsa on 22 January 1997 when she was hit in the shoulder by a 15-centimeter (6 in) piece of blackened metallic material. U.S. Space Command confirmed that a used Delta II rocket from the April 1996 launch of the Midcourse Space Experiment had crashed into the atmosphere 30 minutes earlier. The object tapped her on the shoulder and fell off harmlessly onto the ground.
